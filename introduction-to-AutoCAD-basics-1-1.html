                    <p>Welcome to the world of CAD - In this first tutorial you will be learning the very basics
                        of
                        AutoCAD. This course is designed so that the commands and instructions should work on
                        almost
                        any version of AutoCAD, although this version is designed specifically for AutoCAD 2021
                        and
                        will work with older versions. By the end of this level you will have the skills to
                        develop
                        basic 2D drawings and print them out to scale.</p>
                    <p>Let's start at the beginning, these things you need to know, or the rest of it won't make
                        any
                        sense at all. Make sure you have a very good understanding of this lesson before
                        continuing.
                        This lesson is longer than most (and not very exciting) but will cover important topics.
                        Learn it, live it. Stick to it! You'll thank me later.</p>
                    <div id="coordinate-system">
                        <h4>The X,Y coordinate system</h4>
                        <p>Everything that you draw in AutoCAD is exact. It will be more accurate than you will
                            ever
                            need it to be. We're talking 14 decimal points accurate. All objects drawn on the
                            screen
                            are placed there based on a simple X,Y coordinate system. In AutoCAD this is known
                            as
                            the World Coordinate System (WCS). You must understand this to know how to put
                            things
                            where you want them. (3-D work has an added axis, the Z-axis, but this is not
                            covered in
                            this lesson.) Below is a diagram showing you how this system works (place your mouse
                            on
                            the diagram for more info). <span class="helptip"

                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Here is how it works:</strong>
                            <br>AutoCAD uses points to determine where an object is located. There is an origin
                            where it begins counting from. This point is (0,0). Every object is located in
                            relation
                            to the origin. If you were to draw a line straight out to the right from the origin,
                            this would be considered the positive X-axis. If you were to draw a line straight
                            up,
                            this would be the positive Y-axis. The picture above shows a point located at (9,6).
                            This means that the point is 9 units over in the X-axis and 6 units up in the
                            Y-axis.
                            When you are working with points, X always comes first. The other point shown is
                            (-10,-4). This means that the point is 10 units in the negative X-axis (left) and 4
                            units in the negative Y-axis (down).</p>
                        <p>A line has two points, a start point and an end point. AutoCAD works with the points
                            to
                            display the line on the screen. Move your cursor over the picture above and you will
                            see
                            line drawn from the <a href="#absolute"><strong>absolute</strong></a> points of
                            (-10,-4)
                            to (9,6). Most of the time you will not have an indication of where the origin is.
                            You
                            may need to draw a line from the endpoint of an existing line. To do this you use <a
                                href="#relative"><strong>relative</strong></a> points. These work the same way,
                            but
                            you have to add the @ symbol (shift+2) to tell AutoCAD that this next point is
                            relative
                            from the last point entered. myCADsite.com</p>

                        <p>It's a simple system, but mastering it is the key to working with AutoCAD and is
                            explained in more detail further below and in the next lesson. In order to work
                            effectively with AutoCAD, you have to work with this system. Until you are
                            comfortable
                            and familiar with it, learning AutoCAD will be more of a chore. My experience in
                            teaching is that the better a student is with coordinates, the faster they will
                            learn.

                        <p>When drawing lines at an angle, you have to begin measuring the angle from 0 degrees,
                            which is at the 3 o'clock position. If you drew a line at 90 degrees, it would go
                            straight up. The example above (when you move your mouse over it) shows a line drawn
                            at
                            +300 degrees (270+30), or -60 degrees. You might not always have an obvious
                            reference
                            point for 0 degrees. Look at the example below and place your mouse on the image to
                            find
                            out the angle in question.</p>
                        <div class="text-center diagram">
                            <img src="images/angle1.gif" class="img-fluid lazy" alt="?=30 DEGREES"
                                title="?=30 DEGREES">
                        </div>
                        <p>In this example, you are given information about the lines, but not the angle AutoCAD
                            needs to draw the line from the start point. What you are given though, is (a) the
                            knowledge that 0° is at the 3 o'clock position (b) the knowledge that 180° is at the
                            9
                            o'clock position and (c) the angle between 180° and the line you want to draw is
                            150°.
                            With this information, you can figure out what angle you need. Here is a fool-proof
                            way
                            of getting the angle you need:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Start at the 0° position and measure counter-clockwise (+) to 180°.</li>
                                <li>From 180°, measure clockwise 150° (-)</li>
                                <li>Consider that you just went +180-150 and use that as an equation:

                        <p>ou can enter points directly on the command line using three different systems. The
                            one
                            you use will depend on which is more applicable for the situation. The first
                            assignment
                            in the next lesson will show you these methods. The three systems are as follows:

                                title="There are other ways of drawing lines, but all methods are based on these 3 systems.

                            <p id="absolute"><strong>ABSOLUTE CO-ORDINATES</strong> - Using this method, you
                                enter
                                the points as they relate to the origin of the WCS. To enter a point just enter
                                in
                                the exact point as X,Y.</p>
                            <p id="relative"><strong>RELATIVE CO-ORDINATES</strong> - This allows you to enter
                                points in relation to the first point you have entered. After you've entered one
                                point, the next would be entered as @X,Y. This means that AutoCAD will draw a
                                line
                                from the first point to another point X units over and Y units up relative to
                                the
                                previous point.</p>
                            <p id="polar"><strong>POLAR CO-ORDINATES</strong> - You would use this system if you
                                know that you want to draw a line a certain distance at a particular angle. You
                                would enter this as @D&#60;A. In this case, D is the distance and A is the
                                angle.
                                Example: @10&#60;90 will draw a line 10 units straight up from the first point.
                                <br>The three ways of entering coordinates shown above are the ONLY way AutoCAD
                                accepts keyboard input. First decide which style you need to use, and then enter
                                as
                                shown. Remember that X is always before Y (alphabetical). Don't forget the '@'
                                symbol when you are entering relative points. Any typing error or omission will
                                give
                                you results you don't want. If you make a mistake and need to see what you
                                typed,
                                press F2 to bring up the text screen and check your typing. (press F2 to get

                        <h4 id="workspace">Workspaces</h4>
                        <p>With the introduction of AutoCAD 2009, a new screen layout was added. The program now
                            allows you to work in different workspaces depending upon what you are working on.
                            For
                            example, the screen will look different if you are working on 2D than it will with
                            3D
                            work. There is also an option for AutoCAD Classic (which is how the screen looked
                            from
                            Versions 2000-2008). This set of tutorials will deal with the new new workspace.
                            Since
                            you are a new user, you may as well learn the new interface. If you want to use the
                            Classic interface, you can use the tutorials for AutoCAD 2008.
                            <br>For the first 2 levels of tutorials, you will want to be in the 2D Drafting &
                            Annotation workspace. Set this by clicking in the bottom right of the AutoCAD screen
                            on
                            the 'gear' icon as shown in the image below. In AutoCAD 2012, this is at the top of
                            the
                            screen.</p>

                        <h4>Icons, Keystrokes and Menus</h4>
                        <p>There are many ways to do things in most Windows programs. AutoCAD is no exception.
                            Everyone will develop a way that works best for him or her. In this course, we will
                            primarily be working with the keystroke commands. The reason for this is because
                            they
                            will work in most AutoCAD versions (including DOS versions), and in some other CAD
                            programs. The icons work well, but as you will see, icons can be placed anywhere on
                            the
                            screen and can be difficult to find quickly. You may be working on another
                            employee's
                            computer that is set up differently than what you're used to. The pull-down menus
                            will
                            access almost all commands, but are a slower way of doing things. Icons in AutoCAD
                            2010
                            to AutoCAD 2021 are found on the ribbon, divided into panels - just click on the
                            appropriate tab to open the panel you need..</p>
                        <p>Example: If you want to draw a line, you can do it a few ways:</p>
                        <p>At the command line type: LINE (or) L and press the ENTER key. Select the line icon
                            from
                            the DRAW Panel.</p>
                        <div class="diagram">
                            <img src="images/line_tool.gif" title="Line Icon" class="img-fluid lazy"
                                alt="Line Icon">
                        </div>
                        <p>Another way is to Right-Click on the drawing space and choose "Recent Input" from the
                            menu. This will give a list of the most recent commands that you have used.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>All three approaches will do the same thing: prepare AutoCAD to draw a line where you
                            tell it.</p>

                        <p>AutoCAD is a popular program because it can be customized to suit an individual's
                            needs.
                            The toolbars are a good example of this. You can have the toolbars you use most
                            often on
                            the screen all the time. You can easily make them go away so that you have more
                            drawing
                            space. You can also customize them so you have the most common commands on one
                            toolbar.
                            For example, the dimensioning toolbar is one that you will not want taking up space
                            on
                            your screen while drawing, but is very handy when you're dimensioning your drawing.
